## Background
Unsupervised learning is a machine learnign model that finds patterns in unstructured data sources such as images.It is typically used when there is no known output which is the case in the cryptocurrency dataset utlized in this project. 

## Purpose:
The purpose of this porject is to create an analysis report that will help clients seeeking to enter the cryptocurrency marke. The analysis report includes the types of cryptocurrencies that are in the trading market and how they could be clustered to create a classification system for new investment.Utlizing Python Pandas, and scikit-learn we processed data to fit the machine learning model by means of clustering, reducing dimensions, reducing the principal components. We also utlized hvplot to visualize the results. 

This Repo includes the following technical analysis deliverables.

- Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

# Results 
The total number of tradable cryptocurrencies is 533
